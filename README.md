# KatanaUsdPlugins

The KatanaUsdPlugins originally authored by Pixar and this repository was
originally based on the 19.11 version of the USD library.
https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/releases/tag/v19.11

This section contains libraries and plug-ins for Katana. We have provided a new 
build mechanism to modularize the building process, allowing the plug-ins to be 
built against multiple compatible USD and Katana versions (depending on API 
compatibility). There is a document attached to this repository (BUILDING.md)
which describes how to go about making your own CMake build scripts.

See the [online documentation](http://openusd.org/docs/Katana-USD-Plugins.html)
for more details.
